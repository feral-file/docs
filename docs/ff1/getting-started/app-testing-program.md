# App testing program

We use the Feral File app to control FF1, but the version is still in the development phase.

To join the Feral File app testing program that lets you control FF1, please click the link below:

* [iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/SBt1LsfR){target="_blank"}

Note: Once you join the program, you will be able to update to our development version just like a normal app update via the App Store or Google Play.
