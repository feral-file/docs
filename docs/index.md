# Welcome to Feral File Docs

This site covers everything you need to **build, integrate, or collect** with Feral File.

* Developers → dive into the **Display Protocol, FF OS, and hardware** under Devices.
* Institutions & Collectors → see how to query live exhibitions via the **/api**.
* Artists & Curators → bookmark this site; more material opens up after Wave 1 ships.

→ The first device reference, **FF1 Founders Edition**, lives at `/devices/ff1/`.
