# Welcome to Feral File Docs

Feral File is a cultural institution and technology company. We make it simple to **live with digital art every day** — through curated exhibitions, open protocols, and dedicated hardware.

* **Start with FF1** → [Getting Started](ff1/index.md), our art computer that plays digital art on any screen.
* **Publish & integrate** → [DP-1 Protocol](dp1-protocol/overview.md), an open standard for sharing playlists of digital art.
* **Explore exhibitions & data** → [Exhibitions & Archive](exhibitions-n-archive/exhibition-structure.md), our model for artworks, metadata, and APIs.
